This is a simple memory matching "minesweeper" style game made for hackathon organized by the OSS club at Scaler School Of Technology.

## How to play
1) You can either clone this repository locally and play this game through opening `index.html` file or try out the live version [here](https://memory-matching-sst.netlify.app/).
2) You get 5 seconds in the beginning to memorize and take note of the position of bombs and leaves.
3) Then you need to find and click on all the leaves while avoiding bombs. You can see your time at the bottom-right.
4) If you spot all leaves and avoid the bombs, you win. If you click on a bomb, then it explodes and you lose.
